									<h1>About myself</h1>
									<div class="box">
									<p>My name is Saksham Garg, "I" am a data scientist and full-stack developer with a passion for creating intelligent, data-driven web applications. I
									am currently a student in Bachelor's in Information and technology and have worked in various roles across the technology industry. My
									expertise includes data analysis, machine learning, web development, and cloud computing. I'm motivated by solving
									complex problems with technology, and I'm always looking for new challenges to push my skills to the next level. When
									I'm not working, I enjoy hiking, reading, and playing board games with friends."</p>

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Pic.jpg" alt="" /></span>During my bachelor's degree, I was passionate about exploring the world of technology and its applications. I began by
								focusing on the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms, building a solid foundation in DSA. As I had some prior
								experience in web development, I decided to dive deeper into Full stack web development, learning and practicing complex
								technologies like MERN stack.
								
								With my newfound expertise, I landed my first internship, where I worked on developing full-stack applications. During
								this time, I also completed several advanced projects that expanded my knowledge and challenged me to explore new
								technologies.
								
								While working on web development, I was intrigued by the world of machine learning and its applications. I started by
								improving my knowledge of mathematics and gaining a better understanding of Python. I then delved into deep learning,
								working on projects such as "image text recognition" and "brain tumor detection and segmentation."
								
								My hard work paid off, and I secured a Data Science internship, where I gained valuable experience working on real-world
								problems. During this time, I also published a research paper titled "Segmentation of Spectral Plant Images Using
								Generative Adversary Network Techniques" in the Artificial Intelligence section of the MDPI journal.
								
								Overall, my journey in my bachelor's degree has been one of constant learning and growth. I've gained expertise in
								Full-stack web development, data science, and machine learning, and I'm excited to continue expanding my skills and
								exploring new technologies..</p>
